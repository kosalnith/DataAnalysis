# Data Analysis for Social Science 

This repository is an sample code of the data import, data visualization, data transformation and data export in the R programming. It also used for a sharing session at the 2021 Young Research Fellow Seminar. 

## Course Materials 
* [**Main Data Visualization**](https://github.com/nithkosal/DataVisualization/blob/main/Codes/DataVisualization.Rmd), — with the Rmd file, you can use these codes to replicate it or download it with a PDF export file [here](https://github.com/nithkosal/DataVisualization/blob/main/DataVisualization.pdf). 
* [**Findata Example**](https://github.com/nithkosal/DataVisualization/blob/main/Codes/Findata.R), is a real particle with 2017 financial inclusion microdata covering nearly 150,000 people in 144 economies, representing more than 97% of the world’s population which produced by the World Bank.
* [**Maliecon Example**](https://github.com/nithkosal/DataVisualization/blob/main/Codes/maliecon.R), is a code for a research project on economic development in Mali for the master thesiss which takes from [Phay Thounimith](https://github.com/nimithphay). I would like to point out that he used French in that code.
* [**Slide**](https://github.com/nithkosal/DataVisualization/blob/main/Slide.pdf), a brief description of the purpose of the sharing section and something should be avoided when plotting.
* [**Problem Sets**](https://github.com/nithkosal/DataVisualization/blob/main/Problemsets.pdf), is a exercise file for vectors, matrices and data transformations. More exercises in this file come from the book of [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html) by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham, and come from Programming Exercises for R by Nastasiya F. Grinberg and Robin J. Reed.
