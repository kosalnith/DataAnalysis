# Difference-in-differences model -----------------------------------------

# House prices example
# DID effect of building an incinerator on house prices
KIELMC <- read.csv(paste0(directory, "KIELMC.csv"))

select(KIELMC, rprice, nearinc, y81, y81nrinc) %>% str
select(KIELMC, rprice, nearinc, y81, y81nrinc) %>% stargazer(type = "text")

# Summarize house prices near and far from incinerator, and before and after
KIELMC %>% 
  group_by(nearinc, y81) %>%
  summarize_at(.vars = vars(rprice), 
               .funs = list(mean = mean, obs = length))

# Regression in after period (after building the incinerator)
model1 <- lm(formula = rprice ~ nearinc, 
             data = KIELMC, 
             subset = (year == 1981))
summary(model1)
(b1 <- coef(model1)["nearinc"])

# Regression in before period (before building the incinerator)
model2 <- update(model1, subset = (year == 1978))
summary(model2)
(b2 <- coef(model2)["nearinc"])

# Difference-in-differences effect
b1 - b2

# Regression for treated units (near the incinerator)
model3 <- lm(rprice ~ y81, KIELMC, nearinc == 1)
summary(model3)
(b3 <- coef(model3)["y81"])

# Regression for control units (far from the incinerator)
model4 <- update(model3, subset = (nearinc == 0))
summary(model4)
(b4 <- coef(model4)["y81"])

# Difference-in-differences effect 
b3 - b4

# Difference-in-differences regression 
# includes treated, after, and after*treated
model5 <- lm(rprice ~ nearinc + y81 + y81nrinc, KIELMC)
summary(model5)
coef(model5)["y81nrinc"]
# DID effect is the coefficient on after*treated
# DID effect is same as the difference-in-differences calculated above


# Panel data model with first differences ---------------------------------
# Panel data for wage example
wagepan <- read.csv(paste0(directory, "wagepan.csv"))

# Keep only two years of data
wagepan %<>% filter(year == 1980 | year == 1981)

# Generate dummy for year and interaction term
wagepan %<>% mutate(d1981 = (year == 1981),
                    d1981hours = d1981*hours)

# Get wage from log(wage)
wagepan %<>% mutate(wage = 10^lwage)

# List, describe, and summarize data
select(wagepan, nr, year, wage, hours, educ, exper) %>% head(10)
select(wagepan, nr, year, wage, hours, educ, exper) %>% str
select(wagepan, nr, year, wage, hours, educ, exper) %>% 
  as.data.frame %>%
  stargazer(type = "text")

# Panel data where nr is the cross sectional dimension and year is the time dimension
# Describe and summarize as panel data

# Number of observations
wagepan %>% group_by(nr) %>% summarize(n_nr = n()) # number of obs by 'nr'
wagepan %>% group_by(year) %>% summarize(n_year = n()) # number of obs by 'year'

# Overall variations
wagepan %>% 
  select(wage, hours, educ, exper) %>% 
  mutate_all(function(x) {x - mean(x)}) %>% # variable - overall mean
  as.data.frame %>% 
  stargazer(type = "text", omit.summary.stat = "mean")

# Between variations
wagepan %>% group_by(nr) %>%
  select(wage, hours, educ, exper) %>% 
  summarize_all(mean) %>% 
  as.data.frame %>% 
  select(-nr) %>%
  stargazer(type = "text")

# Within variations
wagepan %>% group_by(nr) %>% 
  select(wage, hours, educ, exper) %>% 
  mutate_all(function(x) {x - mean(x)}) %>% # demean
  as.data.frame %>% 
  select(-nr) %>%
  stargazer(type = "text", omit.summary.stat = "mean")


# Regression model with both years (ignoring that it is panel data set)
model6 <- lm(wage ~ hours + educ + exper, wagepan)
summary(model6)
model7 <- lm(wage ~ hours, wagepan)
summary(model7)
model8 <- lm(wage ~ hours + educ + exper + d1981, wagepan)
summary(model8)

# Regression models for each year
model9 <- update(model7, subset = year == 1980)
summary(model9)
model10 <- update(model7, subset = year == 1981)
summary(model10)

# Regression model with different intercept and slope for both years
model11 <- lm(wage ~ d1981 + hours + d1981hours, wagepan)
summary(model11)

# Generate first differences
diff <- function(x) {x - dplyr::lag(x)}
wagepan %<>% group_by(nr) %>%
  mutate(dwage = diff(wage), 
         deduc = diff(educ), 
         dhours = diff(hours),
         dexper = diff(exper))

wagepan %>% 
  select(nr, year, wage, hours, educ, exper, 
         dwage, dhours, deduc, dexper) %>% 
  head(10)

# Panel data model with first differences
# Cannot be estimated due to perfect collinearity of deduc and dexper
lm(dwage ~ deduc + dexper + dhours, wagepan)

# Panel data model with first differences
lm(dwage ~ dhours, wagepan)
